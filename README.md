FoodingAround is a webpage where you can search for food recipes and wine pairings. 

  WINE -> For the wine pairing part, you need to search for a dish or a specific ingredient in the dish to find the wine pairing and recommendation. It is done using the Spoonacular API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api.
  RECIPES -> Recipes can be searched using ingredients or recipe names and additional requests such as calories per portion, high protein/fiber, and low sodium/fat. The same Spoonacular API is used: https://spoonacular.com/food-api.
            After the search, you will get a component with a list of up to 50 recipes that match your search (can be fewer if the search is more restrictive) from which you can choose one. 
            When you click on the recipe, another component will appear where you can find the recipe's ingredient list, a photo of the dish, and a list of cooking steps.
